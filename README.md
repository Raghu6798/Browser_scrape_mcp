# 🤖 Browser Automation Agent

A powerful browser automation tool built with MCP (Model Controlled Program) that combines web scraping capabilities with LLM-powered intelligence. This agent can search Google, navigate to webpages, and intelligently scrape content from various websites including GitHub, Stack Overflow, and documentation sites.

## 🚀 Features

- **🔍 Google Search Integration**: Finds and retrieves top search results for any query
- **🕸️ Intelligent Web Scraping**: Tailored scraping strategies for different website types:
  - 📂 GitHub repositories
  - 💬 Stack Overflow questions and answers
  - 📚 Documentation pages
  - 🌐 Generic websites
- **🧠 AI-Powered Processing**: Uses Mistral AI for understanding and processing scraped content
- **🥷 Stealth Mode**: Implements browser fingerprint protection to avoid detection
- **💾 Content Saving**: Automatically saves both screenshots and text content from scraped pages

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project uses a client-server architecture powered by MCP:

- **🖥️ Server**: Handles browser automation and web scraping tasks
- **👤 Client**: Provides the AI interface using Mistral AI and LangGraph
- **📡 Communication**: Uses stdio for client-server communication

## ⚙️ Requirements

- 🐍 Python 3.8+
- 🎭 Playwright
- 🧩 MCP (Model Controlled Program)
- 🔑 Mistral AI API key

## 📥 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/browser-automation-agent.git
cd browser-automation-agent
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install Playwright browsers:

```bash
playwright install
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Mistral AI API key:

```
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## 📋 Usage

### Running the Server

```bash
python main.py
```

### Running the Client

```bash
python client.py
```

### Sample Interaction

Once both the server and client are running:

1. Enter your query when prompted
2. The agent will:
   - 🔍 Search Google for relevant results
   - 🧭 Navigate to the top result
   - 📊 Scrape content based on the website type
   - 📸 Save screenshots and content to files
   - 📤 Return processed information

## 🛠️ Tool Functions

### `get_top_google_url`
🔍 Searches Google and returns the top result URL for a given query.

### `browse_and_scrape`
🌐 Navigates to a URL and scrapes content based on the website type.

### `scrape_github`
📂 Specializes in extracting README content and code blocks from GitHub repositories.

### `scrape_stackoverflow`
💬 Extracts questions, answers, comments, and code blocks from Stack Overflow pages.

### `scrape_documentation`
📚 Optimized for extracting documentation content and code examples.

### `scrape_generic`
🌐 Extracts paragraph text and code blocks from generic websites.

├── main.py            # MCP server implementation
├── client.py          # Mistral AI client implementation
├── requirements.txt   # Project dependencies
├── .env               # Environment variables (API keys)
└── README.md          # Project documentation
```

## 📤 Output Files

The agent generates two types of output files with timestamps:

- 📸 `final_page_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png`: Screenshot of the final page state
- 📄 `scraped_content_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`: Extracted text content from the page

## ⚙️ Customization

You can modify the following parameters in the code:

- 🖥️ Browser window size: Adjust `width` and `height` in `browse_and_scrape`
- 👻 Headless mode: Set `headless=True` for invisible browser operation
- 🔢 Number of Google results: Change `num_results` in `get_top_google_url`

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- **🔌 Connection Issues**: Ensure both server and client are running in separate terminals
- **🎭 Playwright Errors**: Make sure browsers are installed with `playwright install`
- **🔑 API Key Errors**: Verify your Mistral API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
- **🛣️ Path Errors**: Update the path to `main.py` in `client.py` if needed
